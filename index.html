            <h2>a little about me...</h2>
                <p>I am passionate about code because the foundational building of form and function inspires me to no end.  
                        I love sleuthing out problems and watching solutions come to life on the screen.  
                        What I find most satisfying is creating elegant functions that translate nicely in any scope,  responsive layout design, and getting creative with simple UX.
                        All things considered, I am a health & wellness enthusiast, a musician, and a firm believer in the good of humanity.  
                        I value communication, perception, and fluidity -the ability to flow and change, or get the flow moving when it isn’t!  
                        When I’m not at my computer you can find me outside communing with the natural world, 
                        creating collaborative arts project and events, and spending quality time with my loved ones.</p>
